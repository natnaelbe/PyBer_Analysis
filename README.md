## The purpose of this analysis is to retrieve the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. We will display these results visually with a chart.
## Based on the chart, the rural cities generated a minimal amount, the suburban areas generated an average cost, and the urban cities generated a maximum cost. Based on the results obtained for the data summary, the outcomes are similar to the plot. However, the average fare per ride is costs more than the suburban and urban fares despite a small demand for rides in rural cities.
## Here are three recommendations for the CEO:
## 1. Provide additional data for ride fares located on the countryside such as places located in Maui, Hawaii.
## 2. Reduce the cost for urban fares.
## 3. Utilize this same data for ride fares, but for major cities that are marketable located in LA, NY, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Houston, etc.
